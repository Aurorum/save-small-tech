# #SaveSmallTech - Campaign to Reform the UK's Online Safety Bill

<img src="/readme_image.png" />

**Digital services in the UK are in danger.**

New legislation planned by this government threatens them with the need to:

- Write an illegal content risk assessment
- Write a content reporting risk statement
- Write a child risk assessment
- Age limit their site (Liz Truss recently claimed she would establish two separate Internets, one for young people and one for adults)
- Write a transparency report
- Register with the regulator
- Pay an annual regulation fee
- Designate a person to prepare a report to Ofcom if requested
- Attend an interview with Ofcom if requested
- Potentially *obtain legal advice*

This is just a handful of the onerous new regulations imposed by the Online Safety Bill.

The Bill has a noble aim: it seeks to prevent the exploitation of young people on online services which has led to many tragic outcomes in recent years, particularly on "Big Tech" platforms such as Facebook.

The Government has rightly agreed to clamp down on practices online which can be dangerous to children.

But this bill is **not** *"just targetting Big Tech"*.

Every home-baking website, maths quiz, online school project, hobbyist forum, online political campaign and movie blog will need to submit to these regulations, regardless of whether they pose any material threat.

The reality is that this new regulation, dressed up to fight back against giants such as Facebook and Google abusing their dominant positions in the industry will in fact kill off small tech projects, business and websites and threaten the UK's digiatal industry in a way that has never been seen before.

The Bill threatens to make large swathes of the Internet illegal in the UK until website owners comply with Ofcom's demands. The result is that many simply won't be able to, and the diversity of Internet services in the UK will be eliminated as only the dominant incumbents can afford to comply with the regulations and retain their position.

But there is a simple solution, which comes in three simple precepts:
- Bring back thresholds: Initially the Bill would target only sites with a user count, employee count or turnover above a given threshold, but these were removed. Bringing these back is the most effective way to protect young people, *and small tech.*
- Require accountability: The Bill grants too much leeway for the Secretary of State to adjust aspects of the regulations without going through due parliamentary process. The Bill can be amended to require accountability to Parliament.
- Repeal and Rework sections 177(2) and 189(2) to remove draconian powers imposed by the Bill and catch-all clauses.

We urge you to join the campaign by emailing your MP with a customisable message about why we need to change the Online Safety Bill using the website: https://savesmalltech.org/
