						<p>Dear <span id="mpname"></span>,</p>
						<textarea id="message">
I am writing to express my concern that the Online Safety Bill is the greatest threat to a free Internet. Regulatory burdens would damage innovation, threatening small businesses and hobby projects of individuals. These include the need to make multiple risk assessments assessing over a dozen factors, paying unspecified fees to Ofcom, and new administrative obligations - even for services which cause no harm online. The majority of small platforms will not have the resources or legal expertise to survive, further consolidating the position of “Big Tech” incumbents that the government has committed to rein in.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This Bill will further disrupt British citizens and the services which they use in their day-to-day lives: whether it be book forums, recipe sharing sites, or educational tools. I’m requesting that you will consider the campaign of #SaveSmallTech when voting on the legislation, and that you will ensure collateral damage is minimised through three key changes:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;1. Return thresholds: platforms who either have limited employees or a worldwide turnover of less than a certain threshold should not be liable. These platforms lack the resources to deal with the new burdens. This approach should be clearly defined in primary legislation rather than left to Ofcom or the Secretary of State. It would be reasonable for the Bill to grant either of them powers enabling these thresholds to be overridden for specific services, provided genuine harm has already been caused and there is judicial oversight.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;2. Remove Section 177(2): this gives the Secretary of State power to unilaterally withdraw exemptions, even without consulting Ofcom. At the stroke of a pen, the government would have the power to jeopardise whole swathes of the Internet: from every single blog to every single online store. It eviscerates certainty, fatally undermining the government’s stated aim of a “predictable framework”, and massively threatens excessive state control. This decision should be made by the people’s representatives, and left solely for Parliament to amend in primary legislation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;3. Rework Section 189(2): this uses catch-all clauses to ensure that the majority of online services are in-scope through the backdoor. The listed functionalities should be much more specific. 189(2)(m) defining scope through the use of hyperlinks should be removed entirely - it is normal practice for websites to use hyperlinks, and they represent a key technology of the World Wide Web.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Without these changes, this Bill would damage livelihoods. At the time of politicians promoting “cutting red tape”, they would destroy small businesses; while raising hopes for “unicorn startups”, they would ensure the next great tech project could almost certainly never be British; and amid claims of “levelling up”, the Internet - perhaps the greatest vehicle of opportunity - would become inaccessible and closed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Thank you, and I look forward to hearing your response.</textarea

					<p>
						Based on government promotion of the Online Safety Bill, you might think it is designed
						to target social media giants: so-called “Big Tech”. That is not the case. The
						government’s Impact Assessment estimates that 25K services would be liable to the new
						regulations. This is a vast underestimate, and either misguided or misleading. It
						arbitrarily assumes that 3K “small platforms” would fall under the Bill, such as forums,
						when that aspect would certainly involve tens of thousands of platforms alone.
						<span class="highlight">The government’s working assumption is utterly wrong</span>.
						With limited exemptions for some comment sections and reviews, all online services are
						in-scope. This means individuals, hobbyists and businesses would have mountains of
						incomprehensible red tape imposed on them.
					</p>
					<p>
						The government has stated that Ofcom will produce “easy to understand guidance” to avoid
						individuals needing to seek legal advice. Ofcom has also acknowledged that the “largest
						online services have capabilities and resources that vastly outstrip those of most
						inscope services”, and have promised proportionality in their response. It is inevitable
						that most smaller services will not fulfil these new legal duties, and likely that Ofcom
						will not take enforcement against them all.
						<span class="highlight"
							>But this current arrangement would involve decent and ordinary citizens placing their
							head in the tiger of Ofcom, and hoping it doesn’t bite</span
						>. There would be chilling ramifications across the Internet when a smaller platform - a
						hobby project of an individual - inevitably becomes targeted. Large swathes of the
						Internet would be considered criminal. With the Secretary of State setting directions
						over Ofcom, it risks even becoming a politicised affair.
					</p>
					<p>
						The principle of the Internet has been about freedom, accessibility, and openness: that
						at no cost, anyone with an idea can contribute an innovation about what matters to them.
						This Bill ends that. Launching a digital project no longer becomes about mere technical
						ability. The regulations will disproportionately deter individuals from creating
						services online, who have neither the money or resources to comply with them, infringing
						their civil liberties on freedom of speech. Pragmatically, many overseas services who
						lack the resources to comply will simply block British access, as over one thousand
						American sites did following the introduction of GDPR. This Bill proposes restrictions
						far more onerous than that, and the consequence will be British residents losing access
						to the services which they enjoy most.
					</p>
					<p>
						Without these changes, the position of incumbents will be consolidated. At the time of
						politicians promoting “cutting red tape”, they would destroy small businesses; while
						raising hopes for “unicorn startups”, they would ensure the next great tech project
						could almost certainly never be British; and amid claims of “levelling up”, the Internet
						- perhaps the greatest vehicle of opportunity - would become inaccessible and closed.

							<h3>Return thresholds</h3>
							<p>
								Previous ministers floated the idea of thresholds as to when the Bill takes effect
								by default, which would remove the regulatory burden from individuals and businesses
								who lack the resources to deal with them. This could take the form of a size
								threshold, which excludes services that have less than a certain number of
								employees. Alternatively, a worldwide turnover threshold could be used, especially
								since liabilities are financial. Services with more resources have more scope for
								causing harm.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="block">
							<h3>Repeal Section 177(2)</h3>
							<p>
								Section 177(2) gives the Secretary of State power to withdraw exemptions, even
								without consulting Ofcom. At the stroke of a pen, the government would have the
								power to jeopardise swathes of the Internet: every single blog, and every single
								online store. It undermines the stated aim of a “predictable framework”, and
								massively threatens excessive state control. This decision should be made by the
								people’s representatives, and left solely for Parliament to amend in primary
								legislation.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="blocks-wrapper">
						<div class="block">
							<h3>Require accountability</h3>
							<p>
								This approach should be clearly defined, with the thresholds written in primary
								legislation rather than left to Ofcom or the Secretary of State. It would be
								reasonable for the Bill to grant either of them powers enabling these thresholds to
								be overridden for specific services. These must be reserved for the very rare
								occasions where genuine harm has <em>already</em> been caused by a service, and
								should be subject to either parliamentary or judicial oversight.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="block">
							<h3>Rework Section 189(2)</h3>
							<p>
								Section 189 uses “catch-all clauses” to ensure that the majority of online services
								are in-scope through the backdoor, even though the government claim otherwise. The
								listed functionalities of what makes an in-scope service should be substantially
								more specific. 189(2)(m) defining scope through the use of hyperlinks should be
								removed entirely. It is normal practice for almost all websites to do this, and a
								key principle of the Internet.

					<p>
						The focus of this campaign is around the scope of the Bill, which has not been debated
						properly. The government’s Impact Assessment has too easily been accepted as fact by
						Parliament, even though it does not add up.
						<span class="highlight">Changing the scope of the Bill would be a massive success</span
						>. It would save small services, keep the Internet more accessible to innovation, and
						prevent a monopoly of “Big Tech” - all without compromising online safety.
					</p>
					<p>
						But there are many other areas of this Bill which are flawed, most of which have been
						taken up by other civil liberty organisations:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The government will have unprecedented powers to determine what is “legal but
							harmful”, and consequently what should be censored online
						</li>
						<li>
							Social media companies will be encouraged to “err on the side of censorship” at the
							threat of huge fines and criminal liability, using automated technology that fails to
							understand the context or intent of posts
						</li>
						<li>
							Children - including teenagers, and those above the age of consent - risk losing
							access to valuable online resources that have become part of their routine (eg.
							YouTube) in the name of “preventing harm” when parental restrictions already exist on
							a broadband level
						</li>
						<li>
							Some services (including ones not focused on adult content) will be mandated to
							collect IDs, making the Internet more inaccessible and exacerbating the risk of
							database breaches - there were multiple suicides when this happened over a dating site
							encouraging affairs in 2015
						</li>
						<li>
							Encryption will be undermined by the Bill targeting private messages, threatening
							digital privacy and those who rely on it for their own safety
						</li>
						<li>
							Journalists are granted additional freedom of speech protections - but why should the
							state determine who is a journalist, and why can’t all users receive them?
						</li>
						<li>
							Thresholds for the new “false communication” and “harmful communication” offences,
							which carry up to two-year custodial sentences, are low and based on perception of
							another individual rather than the defendant’s intent
						</li>
						<li>
							Ofcom may withhold details of enforcement “not appropriate for publication”, including
							when they have sought a court order (“Access Restriction Order”) to remove an entire
							service from British access. It is unclear if this will be subject to FOI disclosure
							either
						</li>
